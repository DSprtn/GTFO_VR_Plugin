Total changelog: (1.2.1b):
- Added ProtubeVR Haptics support
- Tweaked every weapon in the game to have its own haptics 'identity'


Known issues:
- GTFO is very VRAM hungry! If your texture or render resolution settings are too high and you're using too much VRAM your game will be very unstable!
  Changing resolution in-game or even playing some maps might cause crashes depending on your resolution and/or texture resolution settings!
  
- For Quest headsets: Link/airlink are very crash-prone. Playing using VD is recommended.

- VR Performance kit causes darkened image output. The fixed version provided in the main release only seems to work on the Valve Index.
